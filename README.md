# Blind Leading the Blind
The goal of this project is to develop an electronic/embedded system to help a blind person navigate a school building setting. We created an Arduino based handheld feedback hub named the "Meta Controller". It uses vibration motors to alert the user if an ultrasonic sensor detected an object in a certain direction and a magnetometer paired with a servo motor to act as a tactile compass.
